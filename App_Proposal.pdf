### 📦 4. The Bonus "Proposal" Document

**Project Title:** StationGuardian - Real-Time Safety Augmentation
**Team:** Algorithm_Rangers

**1. The Problem:**
In emergency scenarios on the ISS (e.g., smoke filling the cabin), visual identification of safety gear becomes difficult. Astronauts need a digital overlay to highlight critical equipment instantly.

**2. The Application:**
StationGuardian runs on standard tablets. It processes the camera feed using our trained YOLOv8 model to draw bounding boxes around 7 types of safety equipment.

**3. Maintaining Relevance with Falcon (Bonus):**
The ISS is constantly evolving. When new tools are sent to space, we cannot easily take thousands of photos of them in zero-gravity for training.
* **Solution:** We use **Duality Falcon** to generate digital twins of the new equipment.
* **Workflow:**
    1.  New equipment 3D model is loaded into Falcon.
    2.  Falcon generates 5,000 synthetic images with varied lighting/angles.
    3.  StationGuardian pipeline automatically retrains the model.
    4.  New model weights (`best.pt`) are pushed to the station devices.
